<p align='center'>
This is a Flutter based Android Application Development project done onbehalf of the Mobile Application Development Module. First of all please bare following things in your mind,    

* This App will demonstrate basic functionalities of what I have learned. (First time Flutter Learner)
* This is not a fully completed app.
* Most of the functions are yet be learned and applied. But you will be able to do some basic functionalities in the app. :smile:

Now let's see what is the purpose of the app! This is more like a day to day tracking app where GYM owner can keep record of members, trainers, equipments and financial records. It is not like a complete complex database driven app. This is more like a entry level app which provide basic CRUD activites for the app functions. 

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
